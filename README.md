**beegae** is a port of beego intended to be used on Google's AppEngine. There are a few subtle differences between how beego and beegae initalizes applications which you can see for yourself here [example](https://github.com/astaxie/beegae/tree/master/example)

The aim of this project is to keep as much of beego unchanged as possible in beegae.
